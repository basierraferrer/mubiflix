# Mubiflix

Mubiflix is an application developed in Flutter, this application was created for educational purposes, it shows the recently released movie in theaters, two movies list top rated and most popular.

## Funtionality

The application has two pages Home and detail

   - `feature`: last movie realase in theatres.
   - `Top rated`: list of movies ordered by rating.
   - `Most popular`: list of movies ordered by popularity.
   - `Movie detail`: pick a movie and see detail of that movie, overview, runtime, poster image, cast list.

## Design

I choose a design from uplabs, this is a website for designers and developers to find and share resources to build apps and sites. I select a Movie Streaming Mobile App Template by Graphic clue.

## Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

### Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

### Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

#### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

#### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_. To config _Android Emulator_ you must follow the instructions [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds)

If you have a _physical Android device_, you can use it for development in place of an AVD by plugging it in to your computer using a USB cable and following the instructions [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/running-on-device).
